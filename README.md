**Drupal (Awesome) Frontend Tooling**

### Install

```sh
npm install @reloaddk/drupal
```

The above package contains everything you would need to have your frontend up
and running.

### Configuration

Take a look in `/packages/drupal/config`. These are example configs that provides
a good starting point but might as well be used as is.

Copy them into your own project. In root or at custom theme level dependant upon
your setup.
